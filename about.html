        <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
        <p>Hey! I'm Ratshili Masala Gift, a web developer with a strong passion for building clean, functional, and user-friendly websites. I love working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL to bring ideas to life. Whether it's front-end styling or back-end logic, I enjoy solving problems and making things work.</p>
        
        <h3>My Journey</h3>
        <p>It all started with a curiosity about how websites work, which turned into a full-on passion for coding and web development. Over time, I’ve built projects that focus on simplicity, responsiveness, and a smooth user experience. I’m always learning new things and improving my skills.</p>
        
        <h3>Beyond Coding</h3>
        <p>Outside of web development, I'm also into cybersecurity, especially ethical hacking. The idea of securing systems and preventing cyber threats really excites me. I also have a deep interest in forex trading, where I analyze market trends and work on trading strategies.</p>
        
        <h3>Why Work With Me?</h3>
        <p>If you're looking for someone who’s dedicated, adaptable, and always up for a challenge, I'm your guy! I love collaborating with people who have great ideas and turning those ideas into reality.</p>
